THE PROCESS

So how did I tackle this problem?
Well, I approached it in five steps:
1.	Understanding business needs: I made sure that I knew what the business wanted me to do with their data first before starting out because the key to success on any data project is to understand the business problem.

Problem

Talkativ wants to uncover the following insights from the data gotten from their online community:
•	Topics that are of interest in their online community
•	The champions within their online community.

2.	Data Extraction: after understudying the business problem, I exported data from the Designers’ WhatsApp chat (their online community).

3.	Data Processing: after extracting the raw data, I needed to process it to fit into a data frame that can answer the business questions and produce insights. I was able to achieve this using Microsoft Excel Power Query where I created four tables from the raw data, cleaned the data and saved the workbook.
Below are pictures of what the various data tables look like ranging from the raw data to the clean tables.

                       The Steps for cleaning the data are below;

The file containing the queries for cleaning the data are in this repository if you need to go through them.

4.	Creating relationship model and visuals: with my new data sets, I used my analytical skills to uncover insights from the datasets and produce visualizations to describe the insights. These visuals were created using Tableau where I created a relationship in data model from my four data tables.

    Below are some of the visuals and dashboard created from the data.
